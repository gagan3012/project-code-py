# Leetcode using AI :robot:
GPT-2 Model for Leetcode Questions in python 

**Note**: the Answers might not make sense in some cases because of the bias in GPT-2 Current accuracy is capped at 90%.

### 📢 Favour:

It would be highly motivating, if you can STAR⭐ this repo if you find it helpful.

## Model

Two models have been developed for different use cases and they can be found at https://huggingface.co/gagan3012

The model weights can be found here: [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gagan3012/project-code-py) and [DistilGPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gagan3012/project-code-py-small)

The model has been trained using **Weights and Biases (Wandb)** and **PyTorch**

GPT Neo model: https://huggingface.co/gagan3012/project-code-py-neo

### Example usage:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelWithLMHead

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gagan3012/project-code-py")

model = AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained("gagan3012/project-code-py")
```

## Demo
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/gagan3012/project-code-py/app.py)


A streamlit webapp has been setup to use the model: https://share.streamlit.io/gagan3012/project-code-py/app.py

### Question:

```
Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly. It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.
```

### Answer:

```python
""" Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly. It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.

For example,
a = 1->2->3
b = 3->1->2
t = ListNode(-1, 1)

Note: The lexicographic ordering of the nodes in a tree matters. Do not assign values to nodes in a tree.
Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3]
Output: 1->2->5
Explanation: 1->2->3->3->4, then 1->2->5[2] and then 5->1->3->4.


Note:

The length of a linked list will be in the range [1, 1000].
Node.val must be a valid LinkedListNode type.
Both the length and the value of the nodes in a linked list will be in the range [-1000, 1000].
All nodes are distinct.
"""
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, head: ListNode, val: int) -> None:
        """
        BFS
        Linked List
        :param head: ListNode
        :param val: int
        :return: ListNode
        """
        if head is not None:
            return head
        dummy = ListNode(-1, 1)
        dummy.next = head
        dummy.next.val = val
        dummy.next.next = head
        dummy.val = ""


s1 = Solution()
print(s1.deleteNode(head))
print(s1.deleteNode(-1))
print(s1.deleteNode(-1))

   ```
